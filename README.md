In this dataset find the dependent and independent variable and write codes for k-means clustering, agglomerative clustering, DBSCAN and check the accuracy of all clustering algorithms.



Tools used – pandas, exploratory data analysis, sklearn, k-means clustering, agglomerative clustering, DBSCAN.



Outcome – the k-means clustering made 2 clusters, agglomerative clustering made 3 clusters and DBSCAN found epsilon =0.2, outliers, small clusters based on core points and decision points.
